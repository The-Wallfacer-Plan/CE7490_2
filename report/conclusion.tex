\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we have implemented the RAID 6 data storage to tolerant up to two drive faults at the same time. It allows the user to input a chunk of data with various lengths, and to specify the number of drives. It then stores the file distributed over the virtual disk drives. Moreover, the implementation adapts several parallism mechanisms for I/O operations and CPU computations; additionally, it optimizes the Galois field multiplication specially targeted to $\left\{02\right\}$ and also precomputes a lookup table to speed up the calculation, which greately improved the performance of RAID 6 architecture. Throughout this project, we have leant and grasped the basic knowledge of RAID storage, and parallel strategies in presence of data integrity.
